# SGBtetrisAI

A tetris AI for the original GameBoy Tetris, working on real hardware using a SNES with Super Game Boy (SGB), an FPGA and an MCU (probably esp32)

Follow up project of one of my first FPGA projects, where I did this using a DMG gameboy, EP4CE6 and an Arduino Mega2560, which kind of worked but was very unstable (because I had no idea how to properly design hardware)
